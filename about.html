        <h2>Who we really are:</h2>
        <P> <p>What if women our age were given the same opprtunity to become technologically sound, and with the advent of cybercrimes, there had never been a better time to equip our women with requisite skills to combat the unending incidences of cybercrimes. </P>
        <p>X-HerOnline is a non-profit organisation founded in 2020, with the sole aim of bridging the gender inequality gap in the technology space, particularly in the area of Cybersecurity.</p>
        <p>This we do, by empowering girls and women in Nigeria(for starters), between ages 16-40, with requisite cybersecurity skills in their preferred area of specialization. </p>
        <p>We understand how broad the Cybersecurity field is, and so, we are providing skills in a number of cybersecurity specializations.</p>
        <p>Besides the former, we have realised the implication of getting our girls and women technologically empowered, especially in this age and time. The impact is truly unquantifiable, to say the least,</p>
